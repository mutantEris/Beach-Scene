Behold, if you will, (and you WILL) my cute little beach.
This beach is just a little slice of something I have created for a much larger and wetter project I am in the middle of developing.
This is, more importantly, quite possibly the most juicylicious beach you have ever laid eyes upon... and theres plenty more to come. 

Here we have Chauncey, standing under his stupid little umbrella.

You will be seeing plenty of Chauncey.

Best sphere-kicker this side of the beach. Way to go Chaunce.

He REALLY wishes he could play basketsphere, but those dreams of being tall will forever remain out of reach.

He's just gonna chill for a bit probably. He IS on vacation after all.
